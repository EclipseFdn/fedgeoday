    <teaser>Christian Rasmussen, Open Source Software Development Lead at NGA, shared NGA's open source strategy</teaser>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>NGA has open sourced millions of dollars of code to GitHub over the last year. The software ranges from geospatial big data systems to source code for first responder apps.  Mr. Rasmussen will discuss NGA's open source strategy and the agency's cultural pivot toward a more unclassified future.</p>

    <title>Open source inspired workflows for open (and closed) geospatial data</title>
    <teaser>Ben Balter, Government Evangelist at Github, speaks about how open source workflow can benefit government.</teaser>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>
Open source software is produced by distributed teams rarely in the same place at the same time, rarely working on the same thing at the same time, yet they consistently produce better results than their closed source and proprietary counterparts. A big part of their continued success is open source's uniquee workflow and tools. What would it look like to treat geospatial data with the same respect that open source developers treat their code? What if we took the tools and workflows of open source and used them to create collaborative geospatial tools and datasets, even if that data was ultimately never public?</p>

    <title>Geospatial Big Data and Predictive Analytics</title>
    <teaser>Abe Usher, CTO at HumanGeo, explains how government can benefit from analysis of public data.</teaser>
    <body><![CDATA[<p> 
      vitae,mount of geolocated information from automated sensors and publicly available sources continues to grow at an exponential rate.  This information, properly handled, will provide new opportunities for commercial industry and government.  During this talk Abe Usher, HumanGeo Chief Technology Officer, provides an overview of how publicly available information combined with new geospatial tools is enabling predictive analytics.</p>

    <title>Mapping 'Big Data' with OpenGeo Suite</title>
    <teaser>Ann Johnson, CEO from Boundless, discusses how the open source OpenGeo Suite can be used to derive benefits from big data in government.</teaser>
    <body><![CDATA[
<p>As the Federal government moves ever further into the world of SmallSats,
full-motion video, social media, and volunteer geographic information,
there is an increased need to handle geospatial 'big data'.  This talk
will cover how Boundless has designed the OpenGeo Suite to handle the
management, visualization, analysis and dissemination of geospatial big
data in a world of shrinking budgets and reduced resources.</p>

    <title>Fast, Distributed Geoprocessing with GeoTrellis</title>
    <teaser>Robert Cheetham, CEO at Azavea, discusses examples of how a powerful open source technology called GeoTrellis can be used to inform government policy.</teaser>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>This talk will give an overview of the GeoTrellis framework; how it leverages features of Scala, Akka, Spark and other frameworks; and how it can be integrated with conventional web mapping tools to create apps that are more than just dots on a map.  The talk will also give an overview of applications for online geoprocessing in several domains including:  stormwater modeling, education games, infrastructure prioritization, climate change and transportation.</p>

    <title>Decision Making Data: Building the Future of Government Technology</title>
    <teaser>Santiago Giraldo, Civic Technologist at Cartodb, explains</teaser>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>Emerging and rapidly growing location intelligence technology has become an essential insight tool for the modern government. We are in the midst of a necessary shift in how we approach processes of evaluation and decision making in the ever expanding paradigm of government data. Technologies such as CartoDB are quickly reframing how we understand and approach the challenges faced by federal agencies. Real-time mapping, web-based data visualization, and fast, almost-instantly leverageable spatial analysis allows for agencies to quickly make important decisions effectively mitigating potential risks, increasing evaluation and response times, and allowing for a large degree of agility in processing information. Let's build the future of government location intelligence together.</p>

    <title>Embracing Open Source for Real -- Deploying, Enhancing, and Developing OSS in the Federal Government</title>
    <teaser>Ben Tuttle, Project Scientist at NGA shares experiences developing and using open source technologies at a federal agency.</teaser>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>Open source software has long been used by government agencies with great
success and significant cost and capability benefits. However, it has also
long been misunderstood and deploying, enhancing or developing OSS has been
a significant challenge at times. Recently the NGA has begun to fully
embrace OSS and break down some of these barriers leading to increased
efficiencies, improved capabilities, and better engagement with the OSS
community. We will talk about how this happened, the benefits to the
government and the OSS community, as well as the agency GitHub account where
government developed code is being released back to the public under OSS
licenses.  </p>

    <title>GeoWave: Geospatial Indexing in Accumulo</title>
    <teaser>Rich Fecher, Software Engineer at RadiantBlue, describes the GeoWave project.</teaser>
    <body><![CDATA[<p>GeoWave is an open source software project developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with RadiantBlue Technologies and Booz Allen Hamilton.  GeoWave leverages the scalability of a distributed key-value store for effective storage, retrieval, and analysis of massive geospatial datasets.  It currently does so by providing plugins to connect GeoTools, PDAL, and Mapnik to an Accumulo based data store.  Leveraging this architecture, GeoWave is able to provide Hadoop input and output formats for distributed processing and analysis of geospatial data, and is able to enable sharing and visualization of massive geospatial datasets using Mapnik or GeoServer.  GeoWave intends to bridge gaps between popular geospatial projects, the realm of distributed key-value stores, and distributed processing frameworks with continued integration efforts on the roadmap.</p>
